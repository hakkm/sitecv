    [me]: the order is not important because for exemple in competitive
    programming i understand what the result should be(maybe that
    is defining the problem), and
    then i faced problems that i have to define clearly, and
    solve
    <!-- WR: to see later -->

    <h2>1. Define clearly what exactly is the problem</h2>
    <p>Get the facts get taht real facts not the apparent
    facts or the obvious facts but the real facts of the
    situation. it's amazing how much time and energy is wasted every
    day attempting to solve problems when it's not even clear at
    the first place. </p>
  <!-- I can add: tell the solution and then go to the editor
and write code.  -->

<h2>2. Ask what are all the possible causes of this problem.</h2>
<p>how and why did it happen? understanding the process of
how the things works make the solutiion obvious [exemple of
limits, in math in generall]. Sometimes this exercise alone
will suggest a solution and remember there's a direct relationship
between the reasons that you come up (understanding the
the origin of the problem) and the likelihood -الاحتمالية-
that a solution will pop out. the best reasons you come up
withthe likelihood a solution will pop out.  </p>
